# spotify tracklist extracter

This scripts extracts the tracklist from a playlist's `.html` file, which is in the current directory and its name (without the extension) is specified in the global variable `FILE_NAME`.

Log in to spotify web, go to the playlist in question and download the .html file (`ctrl+s` on most browsers). That will download the `.html` file and a folder with all the files from the page. 

Right now the download of the cover has to be done manually.
